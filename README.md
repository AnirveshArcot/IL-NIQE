# Perceptual-Index
This is a repo for calculating perceptual quality in SR.
The file is from [video-quality](https://github.com/aizvorski/video-quality).
However, the result is different from that in MATLAB version in [PIRM2018](https://github.com/roimehrez/PIRM2018).
The reason is unknown temporarily.
